    -> https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension
    -> npm install -g yo generator-code
    -> to install globally
    -> now run
        -> yo code
        -> to create a project
    -> now chose a choice what kind of extention for this project we choce:

        > npm
        yarn

-> for this project we will delete a 'src/test' folder
-> we will going to use textension.ts

-> while running for the firlst time error:
    -> The talk 'npm:watch' cannot be tracked. Make sure to have a problem matcher defined.
    -> configure task
    -> npm::compile
    -> now it task it will add some script

=> Run the extention:
    -> in task.json those are the task that it run to run the extention
    -> but rignt now we don't want any task so we will going to remove all the default task
    -> and we will going to run it our self
    -> on package.json in script we can see :
        -> 	"scripts": {
            "watch": "webpack --watch",
            },
        -> where watch run webpack
    -> now to run the extention type:
        -> yarn watch
    -> which will just going to compile the extention.ts file into the 'dist' folder in 'extention.js'
    -> where webpack transpiles all your code
    -> where it take the .ts file and convert it into javascript file
    -> we will going to remove :	"preLaunchTask": "${defaultBuildTask}" from launch.json file 
    -> for some launch config
    -> now executed the code press f5

=> 
    -> now it will open the another window
    -> where press f1 and type 'hello world' and enter it, it will pop up the message saying "Hello World from VSTodo!"
    -> because we have the script inside the extension like that:
            -> let disposable = vscode.commands.registerCommand("vstodo.helloWorld", () => {
                            vscode.window.showInformationMessage("Hello World from VSTodo!");
                        });
            -> here "helloWorld" is the registering Commange and message is "Hello World from VSTodo!"
